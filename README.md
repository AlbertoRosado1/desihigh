An introduction to the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for senior high schoolers based on Jupyter notebooks, as hosted by [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/master).  Start with
the [Intro](https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/michaeljwilson-desi-highschool-yu1evqti/notebooks/Intro.ipynb) notebook, followed by the [DESI](https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/michaeljwilson-desi-highschool-yu1evqti/notebooks/DESI.ipynb) notebook.  This way you can run your own experiments with DESI data!  We hope to add more examples in the future.  For background to the DESI project,
