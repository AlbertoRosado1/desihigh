Welcome!  You've found introductory notebooks to the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for senior high schoolers, hosted on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/master).  This way you can run your own experiments with DESI data.  We hope to add more examples in the future.  For background to the DESI project,
try this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPXx9tqyzYg) and www.desi.lbl.gov.

For an intoduction to Python, see e.g. https://www.py4e.com/book; The [cheatsheets](https://github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/tree/master/cheatsheets) directory also has some handy
summaries of the basics.

For an introduction to Jupyter notebooks, see e.g. www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/

If you're stuck with a Python question, first try www.google.com.  If you have any questions about this project,
please leave us a [message](https://www.github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/issues/new).  

Like what you see?  Click on watch above and you'll get a notification whenever we add new experiments.

If you've created your own additions, we'd love to see them!  Try ["your first commit"](https://www.medium.com/@haydar_ai/learning-how-to-git-creating-your-first-commit-c753ed2e7498) for adding to our work, or leave us a [message](https://www.github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/issues/new).

When you're done, don't forget to leave us some [feedback](https://forms.gle/LGKMVamrtS5StSv56) that will help development in the future.

Now let's get [started!](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/master).  Following the startup page, you'll want Intro.ipynb, followed by DESI.ipynb and so on.
