Welcome!  You've found introductory notebooks to the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for senior high schoolers, kindly hosted by [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  This way you can run your own experiments with DESI data.  For a great introduction to the DESI project, start with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPXx9tqyzYg) and visit www.desi.lbl.gov.

If you're new to python, don't worry!  You'll pick it up quickly.  You can try e.g. https://www.py4e.com/book to get started and be sure to keep our [cheatsheets](https://github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/tree/master/cheatsheets) directory close by to provide some handy summaries of the basics.

Jupyter notebooks make everything easy when it comes python and (data) science.  You can read all about it [here](www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)

If you get stuck with a python question, first try www.google.com like the pros!  If you have any remaining questions about this project and the science,
just leave us a [message](https://www.github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/issues/new) and we'll get back to you.  

When you're done, don't forget to leave us some [feedback](https://forms.gle/LGKMVamrtS5StSv56) that will us develop things better in the future.  You can also show your support by donating a few dollars
to our favourite charities!  Check out the sponsor button above if you like, but make sure to get parental consent before making any commitments.

<ins> Now let's get [started!](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/master) </ins>.  Following the startup page, you'll want Intro.ipynb, followed by DESI.ipynb and so on.  By that stage you'll be a pro
and can try any of the remaining noteooks. 

:heart: what you see?  Click on watch above and you'll get a notification when we add new experiments in the future.

If you've created your own additions, we'd love to see them!  Try ["your first commit"](https://www.medium.com/@haydar_ai/learning-how-to-git-creating-your-first-commit-c753ed2e7498) for adding to our work, or leave us a [message](https:/www.github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/issues/new).
