Welcome to DESI High!  :school_satchel: You've found introductory notebooks to the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for senior high schoolers, kindly hosted by [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  Here you can join us and run your own experiments with hot-off-the-telescope DESI data :telescope:  For a great introduction to the DESI project, start with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPXx9tqyzYg) and try our [website](www.desi.lbl.gov).

If you're new to python :snake:, don't worry!  You'll pick it up quickly.  You can try this [book](https://www.py4e.com/book) to get started and be sure to keep our [cheatsheets](https://github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/tree/master/cheatsheets) directory close by to provide some handy summaries of the basics.

Everything here is written in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which makes all things easy when it comes python and data science.  You can read all about them [here](www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).

If you get stuck with a python question, be like the pros and try www.google.com!  If you have any science questions :thought_balloon:,
join the [DESI High community](https://join.slack.com/t/desihigh/shared_invite/zt-hcbl1fqp-UH60XG7IAkJBCevkDOAf_A) and we'll be more than happy to help answer them for you.  But remember, all staff and students at DESI High abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) :scroll:.  

When you're done, don't forget to get some extra credit by leaving us with what you [liked](https://forms.gle/LGKMVamrtS5StSv56) :star:.  You can show even more support by donating a few :dollar: to our favourite [charity](https://www.gofundme.com/f/code-nation?utm_source=customer&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&utm_medium=copy_link_more), but make sure to convince your parents first!

:rotating_light:  We're almost ready to go.  You'll first see a loading page, after which you'll want Intro.ipynb and then DESI.ipynb.  By that stage you'll be a pro and can try the rest - SnowWhiteDwarf is one of our favourites.  Ok, wait for it, [GO](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/master)! :rotating_light:

:es: ¡Hola! Para nuestros amigos de habla hispana, querrá consultar [README](https://github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/blob/master/Espanol/README.md) :mexico:

:heart: what you see?  Find out about [watching](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.20/user/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/watching-and-unwatching-repositories#watching-a-single-repository) repositories and you'll get an update when we add new experiments.  If you've created your own, we'd love to see them!  Try ["your first commit"](https://www.medium.com/@haydar_ai/learning-how-to-git-creating-your-first-commit-c753ed2e7498), or just [tell us all about it](https:/www.github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/issues/new).

:whale:  For budding developers, we support [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/mjwilsonlbl/desihigh), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/github/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool) and [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/michaeljwilson/desi-high). :cloud: 

:mortar_board:  If you've studied all there is to know, it may be time to take [The Test](https://github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/blob/master/TheTest/README.md) and [graduate](https://github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/blob/master/Graduation/README.md) from DESI High!
