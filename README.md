Welcome!  You've found introductory notebooks to the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for senior high schoolers, kindly hosted by [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  Here you can join us and run your own experiments with DESI data :telescope:.  For a great introduction to the DESI project, start with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPXx9tqyzYg) and visit www.desi.lbl.gov.

If you're new to python :snake:, don't worry!  You'll pick it up quickly.  You can try e.g. https://www.py4e.com/book to get started and be sure to keep our [cheatsheets](https://github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/tree/master/cheatsheets) directory close by to provide some handy summaries of the basics.

Everything here is Jupyter notebooks, which makes all things easy when it comes python and (data) science.  You can read all about them [here](www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)

If you get stuck with a python question, first try www.google.com like the pros!  If you have any remaining questions about this project and the science,
just leave us a [message](https://www.github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/issues/new) and we'll get back to you.  

When you're done, don't forget to get some extra credit by leaving us with what you [liked!](https://forms.gle/LGKMVamrtS5StSv56) :star:.  You can show even more support by donating a few :dollar: to our favourite [charity](https://www.gofundme.com/f/code-nation?utm_source=customer&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&utm_medium=copy_link_more), but make sure to convince your parents first!

:rotating_light:  We're almost ready to go.  You'll first see a startup page, after which you'll want Intro.ipynb, followed by DESI.ipynb and so on.  By that stage you'll be a pro and can try any of the remaining noteooks.  Ok, wait for it, [GO](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/master)! :rotating_light:

:heart: what you see?  Find out about [watching](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.20/user/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/watching-and-unwatching-repositories#watching-a-single-repository) repositories and you can get notifications when we add new experiments in the future.

If you've created your own additions, we'd love to see them!  Try ["your first commit"](https://www.medium.com/@haydar_ai/learning-how-to-git-creating-your-first-commit-c753ed2e7498) for adding to our work, or leave us a [message](https:/www.github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/issues/new).
