Welcome to DESI High!  :school_satchel: You've found introductory notebooks to the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for senior high schoolers, kindly hosted by [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  Here you can join us and run your own experiments with hot-off-the-telescope DESI data :telescope:  For a great introduction to the DESI project, start with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPXx9tqyzYg) and try our [website](www.desi.lbl.gov).

If you're new to python :snake:, don't worry!  You'll pick it up quickly.  You can try this [book](https://www.py4e.com/book) to get started and be sure to keep our [cheatsheets](https://github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/tree/master/cheatsheets) directory close by to provide some handy summaries of the basics.

Everything here is written in Jupyter notebooks, which makes all things easy when it comes python and data science.  You can read all about them [here](www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).

If you get stuck with a python question, first be like the pros and try www.google.com!  If you have any science questions,
just leave us a [message](https://www.github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/issues/new) and we'll get back to you.  But remember, all staff and students at DESI High abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) :scroll:.  

When you're done, don't forget to get some extra credit by leaving us with what you [liked](https://forms.gle/LGKMVamrtS5StSv56) :star:.  You can show even more support by donating a few :dollar: to our favourite [charity](https://www.gofundme.com/f/code-nation?utm_source=customer&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&utm_medium=copy_link_more), but make sure to convince your parents first!

:rotating_light:  We're almost ready to go.  You'll first see a loading page, after which you'll want Intro.ipynb and then DESI.ipynb.  By that stage you'll be a pro and can try the rest - SnowWhiteDwarf is one of our favourites.  Ok, wait for it, [GO](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/master)! :rotating_light:

:es: ¡Hola! Para nuestros amigos de habla hispana, querrá consultar [README](https://github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/blob/master/Espanol/README.md) :mexico:

:heart: what you see?  Find out about [watching](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.20/user/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/watching-and-unwatching-repositories#watching-a-single-repository) repositories and you'll get an update when we add new experiments.  If you've created your own, we'd love to see them!  Try ["your first commit"](https://www.medium.com/@haydar_ai/learning-how-to-git-creating-your-first-commit-c753ed2e7498), or just [tell us all about it](https:/www.github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/issues/new).

:whale:  For budding developers, we support [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/mjwilsonlbl/desihigh), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/github/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool) and [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/michaeljwilson/desi-high). :cloud: 

:mortar_board:  If you've studied all there is to know, it may be time to take [The Test](https://github.com/michaelJwilson/DESI-HighSchool/blob/master/thetest/README.md) and graduate from DESI High!

:school:  Have a classroom full of students potentially interested in DESI High?  We have an elite team of researchers from across the globe ready to get things   <a href="mailto:desihighinitiative@gmail.com?subject=Meet a researcher:">started for you</a> :earth_africa:.
