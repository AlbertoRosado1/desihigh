# About Lowell High School

Located in San Francisco, Lowell High School is the oldest public high school west of the Mississippi river and has a student body of over 2800 students. With over 250 student-founded and student-led clubs, students of all backgrounds take part in its thriving community and bond over common interests and aspirations. 

## The Collaboration
In the fall of 2020, Lowell's Astronomy Club, Dev Club, EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) Club, and Girls Who Code Club all took part in a collaboration to introduce the DESI High project to their peers. Here are some of the workshops and events they organized:

- Dev Club designed a Python and GitHub Basics Workshop 
- 9/3 all four clubs hosted a joint meeting with over seventy students that attended, introducing them to DESI High and some basic Python and GitHub skills to help them get started
- 9/4, 9/11, 9/15 Dr. Wilson gave three sessions of talks about DESI High, exploring a few of the notebooks and answering questions from students
- Astronomy Club will lead another joint meeting going into depth about spectroscopy and the science behind DESI

### Astronomy Club
Lowell's Astronomy Club was founded in the fall of 2019 by sophmores Emma Yu and Stefanie Garcia with the goal of connecting their peers to exciting new opportunities to explore astrophysics and cosmology. Since then, Astronomy Club has grown to over forty members from all grade-levels and backgrounds. 


### About Astronomy Club's Founder and President, Emma Yu
Having grown up watching *Star Wars* and reading *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, nine-year-old Emma would constantly be kept awake at night by the terrifying notion that she understood hardly anything about the universe. After all, why *couldn't* she lift the remote off of the coffee table with her mind? Who decided that gravity had to be a thing in the first place? Her high school physics class (apart from ruining her favorite cartoons and action movies) provided answers to a few of her questions, but many still remained unanswered. After attending LBNL's Physics in and Through Cosmology Workshop in the summer of 2020, she learned that there were many others To this day, she still lies awake at night thinking about the many unsolved mysteries of the universe.
