Lowell's Astronomy Club was founded in the fall of 2019 by sophmores Emma Yu and Stefanie Garcia with the goal of connecting their peers to exciting new opportunities to explore astrophysics and cosmology. Since then, Astronomy Club has grown to over forty members from all grade-levels and backgrounds. 


## About Emma Yu
Having grown up watching *Star Wars* and reading *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, nine-year-old Emma would constantly be kept awake at night by the terrifying notion that she understood hardly anything about the universe. After all, why *couldn't* she lift the remote off of the coffee table with her mind? Who decided that gravity had to be a thing in the first place? Her high school physics class (apart from ruining her favorite cartoons and action movies) also provided answers to a few of her questions, but many still remained unanswered.

After attending To this day, she still lies awake at night thinking about the total mystery of dark energy and the unknown fate of the universe.
