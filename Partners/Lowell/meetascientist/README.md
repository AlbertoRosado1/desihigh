## About Emma Yu
Having grown up watching *Star Wars* and reading *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, nine-year-old me would constantly be kept awake at night by the terrifying notion that I understood hardly anything about the universe. After all, why *couldn't* I lift the remote off of the coffee table with my mind? Who decided that gravity had to be a thing in the first place? Apart from ruining my favorite cartoons and action movies, my high school physics class also provided answers to a few of my questions, but many still remained unanswered.

After attending To this day, she still lies awake at night thinking about the total mystery of dark energy and the unknown fate of the universe.
