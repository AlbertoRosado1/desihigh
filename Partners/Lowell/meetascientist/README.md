![](images/LowellHighSchoolMainEntranceFromEuclyptausStreet.jpg)
Located in San Francisco, Lowell High School is the oldest public high school west of the Mississippi river and has a student body of over 2800 students. With over 250 student-founded and student-led clubs, students of all backgrounds take part in its thriving community and bond over common interests and aspirations. 

## The Collaboration
In the fall of 2020, Lowell's Astronomy Club, Dev Club, EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) Club, and Girls Who Code Club all took part in a collaboration to introduce the DESI High project to their peers. Here are some of the workshops and events they organized:

- Dev Club designed a [Python](https://www.lowelldev.club/workshop/desi-python-intro) and [GitHub Basics Workshop](https://www.lowelldev.club/workshop/github-intro)
- 9/3 all four clubs hosted a joint meeting with over seventy students that attended, introducing them to DESI High and some basic Python and GitHub skills to help them get started
- 9/4, 9/11, 9/15 Dr. Wilson gave three sessions of talks about DESI High, exploring a few of the notebooks and answering questions from students
- Astronomy Club will lead another joint meeting going into depth about spectroscopy and the science behind DESI

### Astronomy Club
Lowell's Astronomy Club was founded in the fall of 2019 by sophmores Emma Yu and Stefanie Garcia with the goal of connecting their peers to exciting new opportunities to explore astrophysics and cosmology. Since then, Astronomy Club has grown to over forty members from all grade-levels and backgrounds. Some of their activities include giving talks, hosting guest speakers, participating in rocket and experimental design competitions, and hosting star parties and solar viewings.

### Dev Club
Founded by Raphael Cenzano and Cappillen Lee, Lowell Dev Club is a place where anyone can be engaged in the world of computer science. They are focused on teaching high school students how to code using workshops, mentoring, and creating a focused space for students to explore computer science and work on cool projects! You can find out more about their club at www.lowelldev.club, and learn about their parent organization at www.hackclub.com.

### EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) Club
Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS) Club specializes in combining the physical world with code, which integrates the fields of both computer science and computer engineering. They teach members how to solder, make colorful animated RGB displays, animated LED cubes, robots, and many other things useful for studying electrical engineering and computer science in the future!

### Girls Who Code Club
Girls Who Code Club encourages females to learn computer science and equip them with the tools to close the gender gap in technology through student-led lessons, speakers, and talks from local Bay Area tech companies.  No worries, anyone can still join. All genders are welcome. No experience required!

### About Emma Yu, Student Ambassador for DESI High
Having grown up watching *Star Wars* and reading *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, nine-year-old Emma Yu would constantly be kept awake at night by the terrifying notion that she understood hardly anything about the universe. After all, why *couldn't* she lift the remote off of the coffee table with her mind? Did the sky go on forever? Her high school physics class (apart from ruining her favorite cartoons and action movies) provided answers to a few of her questions, but many still remained unanswered. During LBNL's Physics in and Through Cosmology Workshop in the summer of 2020, she met some of the very scientists dedicating their lives to answering those questions, including those working on DESI. When she found out about DESI High, she couldn't wait to share it with her peers. Its connections to current ongoing research about dark energy brought her closer than ever to finding answers to her questions. To this day, she still lies awake at night thinking about the many unsolved mysteries of the universe.
