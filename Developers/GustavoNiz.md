Hola, I am Gustavo Niz (http://fisica.ugto.mx/~gfm/group-members/niz/), a DESI member who after start in string theory in the early 2000s have moved gradually 
to observational cosmology.
Following a PhD degree from the University of Cambridge, two posdocs in the UK, a sabbatical year on a sailboat and a few adventures around the globe, I moved
to the city of Leon, in 2012, where I am an associate professor at the University of Guanajuato.

Currently, most of my research focuses on using three point statistics, a fancy way to say that I look for “triangles” in the distribution of matter in the
Universe. By studying how probable is to find three galaxies on the vertices of a given triangular shape, one can learn about fundamental physics, such as to
understand the nature of dark energy, dark matter, the Gaussianity of the initial conditions, the value of neutrino masses or test Einstein’s theory of gravity.
I hope these ideas become a standard analysis tool in the next generation of galaxy surveys, such as DESI.

Apart from participating in DESI with our group of researchers and highly motivated graduate students, I am the Director of the Instituto Avanzado de Cosmologia 
(IAC) (http://www.iac.edu.mx). It is a Mexican association that strengthens the research community in cosmology and promotes the study of the Universe among the 
general public in Mexico. Among other events, the IAC organises the world-class event “Essential Cosmology for the Next Generation”, unofficially known as 
Cosmology on the Beach. (http://www.cosmologyonthebeach.com/).
