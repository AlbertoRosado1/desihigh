I’m Alma Xochitl Gonzalez Morales, a junior researcher at the University of Guanajuato!

I’m now based in León city in the state of Guanajuato.  It is very close to Guanajuato city, one of the most beautiful in México.  Interestingly, León, and Guanuajuato, host many international events annually, including a Ballon festival, the Rally, and the Cervantino, just to mention some!

I was recently appointed to be co-chair of the DESI scientists interested in the Lyman-alpha forest and help coordinate everyone to work together!  I also help test and improve the DESI code.  For example, I’ve been testing the code that will be used to determine quasar redshifts, using it together with simulated
quasars (where we know the truth) so that we can know how well id does!  I also help my graduate students, mostly from the University of Guanajuato, 
to develop their projects within DESI.

For me, the most intriguing aspect of astronomy/cosmology is the nature of Dark Energy and Dark Matter.  Contributing to know more about these two mysterious 
components of our Universe is just astounding!  Even though DESI is mostly focused on Dark Energy (as the name suggests!), the gathered information will also 
be very helpful to understand Dark Matter.  Now that I’m closely following the status of the project I realize how much work is involved and that it is truly 
a huge effort from many people.  I’m so excited about all the science and knowledge that is being developed every day.

I’m really interested in the popularization of science, particularly with girls.  [Iconmunity](https://www.instagram.com/iconmunity/) and [Technovation Girls Guanajuato](https://twitter.com/TechnovationGTO)) are close to my heart, so I dedicate my free time to a community that organizes small workshops, talks, and science shows.  I hope some of them in the future will become scientists!
